## Introduction

**shahcompbio/nanoquant** is a bioinformatics pipeline for long-read transcriptome quantification using kallisto. It takes Oxford Nanopore or PacBio long-read RNA-seq data (as FASTQ, BAM, or CRAM files) and performs pseudoalignment-based transcript and gene-level quantification using the kallisto bus workflow optimized for long reads.

1. Optional BAM/CRAM to FASTQ conversion ([`samtools`](http://www.htslib.org/))
2. Extract cDNA sequences from genome + annotation ([`gffread`](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/gff.shtml))
3. Build kallisto index and quantify ([`kallisto`](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/))
4. Merge quantification results across samples
5. Present QC ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1
SAMPLE1,/path/to/sample1.fastq.gz
SAMPLE2,/path/to/sample2.fastq.gz
```

Or starting from filtered BAM/CRAM files:

```csv
sample,bam
SAMPLE1,/path/to/filtered_reads.cram
SAMPLE2,/path/to/filtered_reads.bam
```

Each row represents a sample. See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for full details on input types.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run shahcompbio/nanoquant \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
